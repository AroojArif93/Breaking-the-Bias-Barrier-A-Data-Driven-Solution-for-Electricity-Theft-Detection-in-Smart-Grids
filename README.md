Class imbalance problem is the active research area in machine learning. It is a problem that mainly occurs in fraud detection, health problems, malware detection and
many other areas where negative cases are substantially more than positive. Many classification techniques have poor predictive class accuracy for the positive class. These
techniques mainly focus on minimizing the error rate while ignoring the minority class. On data-level different re_sampling techniques are used to balance the class ratio;
however, sometimes, these techniques remove the important information that is necessary to learn the model and cause overfitting. Recently, Ensemble techniques have gained more attention to handle the data imbalance problem. A new approach is introduced, using the re-sampling method in the pre-processing to balance ratio and then providing these pre-processed data to the ensemble model for training. The ensemble model has a diversity of different classifiers. In this paper, we proposed two ensemble
models.
